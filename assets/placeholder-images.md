# Image Placeholders

Replace these placeholder images with your actual event photos:

## Required Images:

1. **logo.png** (40x40px recommended)
   - Your RootsandOrigins Events logo
   - Should work well on dark backgrounds

2. **hero.jpg** (1920x1080px recommended)
   - Main hero background image
   - Should be a high-energy party/crowd photo
   - Will have dark overlay, so bright images work best

3. **crowd1.jpg** (600x400px recommended)
   - Party/event photo for upcoming events section
   - Should show people enjoying an event

4. **crowd2.jpg** (600x400px recommended)
   - Another party/event photo
   - Different angle or event from crowd1.jpg

5. **flyer1.jpg** (400x600px recommended)
   - Event flyer for carousel
   - Portrait orientation works best
   - Should be readable and attractive

6. **flyer2.jpg** (400x600px recommended)
   - Second event flyer for carousel
   - Different event from flyer1.jpg
